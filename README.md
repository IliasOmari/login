# Login System

I'd like to introduce you to my login system prototype.
React.js for a responsive frontend, Express for a robust backend, and Passport.js for secure middleware.

Users can log in using email/password or Google, and security and convenience are our top priorities.

This dynamic prototype creates the basis for continuous improvement and future projects.
